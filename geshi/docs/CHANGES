              CHANGES - Changelog for GeSHi (geshi.php only)

Changes to the code are listed under the version they occured in, with who suggested
it by each one (if there's nobody listed as suggesting it I dreamed it up :)). Users
who suggested an idea often also provided the code that was used as a basis for the
changes - thanks to all who suggested these ideas and gave me the code to show me how!

Language files listed under each version were made by the author beside them, and then
modified by me for consistency/bug fixing.

Please send any bug reports to nigel@geshi.org, or use the bug report tracker
at sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=114997&atid=670231)
